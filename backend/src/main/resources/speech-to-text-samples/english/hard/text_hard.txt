a0283.wav;The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant. 
a0284.wav;There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes. 
a0285.wav;But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine. 
a0286.wav;Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping. 
a0287.wav;Keep an eye on him. 
a0288.wav;Those are my oysters, he said at last. 
a0289.wav;They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued. 
a0290.wav;One by one the boys were captured. 
a0291.wav;The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
vf6-16.wav;The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him
vf6-17.wav;Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive
vf6-18.wav;The ringing of the big bell aroused him
vf6-19.wav;At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened
vf6-20.wav;A dead man is of no use on a plantation
vf6-21.wav;I don't know why you're here at all
vf6-22.wav;What part of the United States is your home
vf6-23.wav;My, I'm almost homesick for it already
vf6-24.wav;She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist
vf6-25.wav;I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up
vf6-26.wav;That came before my A B C's
vf6-27.wav;It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles
vf6-28.wav;But it contributed to the smash
vf6-29.wav;The last one I knew was an overseer
vf6-30.wav;Do you know any good land around here
vf6-31.wav;The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia
vf6-32.wav;I cannot follow you, she said
vf6-33.wav;I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
vf6-34.wav;Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil
vf6-35.wav;His voice was passionately rebellious
vf6-36.wav;Don't you see I hate you
vf6-37.wav;So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves
vf6-38.wav;It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon
vf6-39.wav;He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter
vf6-40.wav;Wash your hands of me
vf7-01.wav;I think it's much nicer to quarrel
vf7-02.wav;I saw it when she rolled
vf7-03.wav;I only read the quotations
vf7-04.wav;He was the soul of devotion to his employers
vf7-05.wav;Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year
vf7-06.wav;You have heard always how he was the lover of Princess Naomi
vf7-07.wav;They ought to pass here some time today
vf7-08.wav;I had been sad too long already
vf7-09.wav;All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy
vf7-10.wav;He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition
vf7-11.wav;I may manage to freight a cargo back as well
vf7-12.wav;O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals
vf7-13.wav;He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino
vf7-14.wav;Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller
vf7-15.wav;You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that
vf7-16.wav;See the length of the body and that elongated neck
vf7-17.wav;They are coming ashore, whoever they are
vf7-18.wav;Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays
vf7-19.wav;Think of investing in such an adventure
vf7-20.wav;Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all
vf7-21.wav;I have been doubly baptized
vf7-22.wav;They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha
